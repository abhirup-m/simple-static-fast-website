# Oh Hey - Welcome to my personal website
My name is Abhirup, and I'm currently a physics PhD student living in India. My favourite things to do include watching seasonal anime, reading mystery novels and spending two hours writing scripts to automate stuff that takes 2 mins. Here's the obligatory [about me](/about/) page, if you want to know more.

All the stuff that can be found on this website is listed on the home page, so scroll through it to see if you find anything interesting.

## So, what do you work on?
The answer to this question depends on how far down the rabbit hole you want to go. For the uninitiated, I work in theoretical condensed matter physics. For the specialists, I work on strongly correlated fermionic systems, focusing on phase transitions of the Mott-Hubbard kind in the context of quantum impurity models.

I am a part of the Emergent Phenomena in Quantum Matter (EPQM) group at IISER Kolkata. The groupâ€™s work involves studying quantum models of correlation and obtaining novel emergent states of matter. The models that have been studied involve quantum magnetism, strong correlation, impurity physics, superconductivity, and others.

## Okay, but is there anything interesting here?
Take a look at these pages.

- My thoughts on certain deep ideas of physics and nature.
- Using the power of scripting languages to do cool stuff.
- Do you like anime?

## What's new?
