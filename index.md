# Oh hey - Welcome to my website

I am Abhirup, a PhD student in physics from India. My favourite things to do include watching seasonal anime, reading mystery novels and spending two hours writing scripts to automate stuff that takes 2 mins. Here's the obligatory [about me](/about/) page.

All the stuff that is present on the website is also mentioned on this home page, so scroll through it to see if you find anything interesting.

## What is my PhD about anyway?
I work in theoretical condensed matter physics, more specifically on strongly correlated fermionic systems. I am a part of the Emergent Phenomena and Quantum Matter (EPQM) group at IISER Kolkata. The groupâ€™s work involves studying quantum models of correlation and obtaining novel emergent states of matter. The models that have been studied involve quantum magnetism, strong correlation, impurity physics, superconductivity, and others.

## Okay, but is there anything interesting here?
Take a look at these pages.

- My thoughts on certain deep ideas of physics and nature.
- Using the power of scripting languages to do cool stuff.
- Do you like anime?

## What's new?
