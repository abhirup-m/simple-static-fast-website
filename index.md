# Oh Hey - Welcome to my website
My name is **Abhirup**, and I'm currently a physics PhD student living in India. My favourite things to do include watching seasonal anime, reading mystery novels and spending hours writing scripts to automate away minutes of work. Here's the obligatory [about me](/about/) page, if you want to know more.

## So, what exactly am I _PhDing_ in?
The answer to this question depends on how far down the rabbit hole you want to go. For the uninitiated, I work in **theoretical condensed matter physics**. For the specialists, I study strongly correlated fermionic systems, focusing on phase transitions of the Mott-Hubbard kind in the context of quantum impurity models. More information can be found [here](/research/).

## Okay, but is there anything interesting here?
Take a look at these pages.

- My thoughts on certain deep ideas of physics and nature.
- Using the power of scripting languages to do cool stuff.
- Do you like anime?

## What's new?
