These are some casual documents I have prepared on various topics while learning them, either for courses I was attending or for my tutor assistantships. They might be helpful as very quick introductions or as an opinionated conglomeration of the ideas of certain topics.

- [**The tight-binding model on the 2D square lattice**](/assets/pdfs/tbm.pdf)
<br>
This is a quick introduction to the tight-binding problem on a 2D square lattice. I describe how it can be obtained from a more general model, its solution and some of its important properties like the isoenergetic contours and van Hove singularities.

- [**Topological significance of the crystal momentum**](/assets/pdfs/bloch.pdf)
<br>
This is a re-working of R. Rajaraman's demonstration that the tight-binding dispersion can be obtained by treating the problem of electrons moving in a periodic potential in terms of instantons. This has the advantage that the crystal momentum can be identified as a topological winding number.

- [**R. Shankar's RG derivation for Landau Fermi liquid and BCS instability**](/assets/pdfs/RG_Shankar.pdf)
<br>
This is an expansion of R. Shankar's derivation (Shankar, 1993) of the Landau Fermi liquid effective Hamiltonian and its possible BCS instability by applying the renormalization group technique on a general 2D interacting fermionic system with a circular Fermi surface. I have added a short introduction to the philosophy of renormalisation group. Certain non-trivial arguments and calculations have also been fleshed out. Where possible, certain parts have been simplified.

- [**Lightning-quick introduction to single site dynamical mean field theory**](/assets/pdfs/dmft.pdf)
<br>
This is a very short introduction to the philosophy and algorithm of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). I brought these points together and wrote this up mostly to cement my own understanding of the topic. I first discuss the Curie-Weiss mean field theory in the context of the Ising model in order to provide a familiar language, and set up in a slightly different way so that it is easily generalised to DMFT. This might be useful for anyone wanting to know, in brief, what DMFT is, and how it is implemented.
