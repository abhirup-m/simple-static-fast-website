      <h1>Oh Hey - Welcome to my personal website</h1>
<p>My name is <strong>Abhirup</strong>, and I'm currently a physics PhD student living in India. My favourite things to do include watching seasonal anime, reading mystery novels and spending hours writing scripts to automate stuff that takes minutes. Here's the obligatory <a href="/about/">about me</a> page, if you want to know more.</p>
<h2>So, what exactly am I <em>PhDing</em> in?</h2>
<p>The answer to this question depends on how far down the rabbit hole you want to go. For the uninitiated, I work in theoretical condensed matter physics. For the specialists, I work on strongly correlated fermionic systems, focusing on phase transitions of the Mott-Hubbard kind in the context of quantum impurity models.</p>
<h2>Okay, but is there anything interesting here?</h2>
<p>Take a look at these pages.</p>

<li>Do you like anime?</li>
