      <h1>Oh Hey - Welcome to my personal website</h1>
<p>My name is Abhirup, and I'm currently a physics PhD student living in India. My favourite things to do include watching seasonal anime, reading mystery novels and spending two hours writing scripts to automate stuff that takes 2 mins. Here's the obligatory <a href="/about/">about me</a> page, if you want to know more.</p>
<p>All the stuff that can be found on this website is listed on the home page, so scroll through it to see if you find anything interesting.</p>
<h2>What's my PhD about anyway?</h2>
<p>I work in theoretical condensed matter physics, more specifically on strongly correlated fermionic systems. I am a part of the Emergent Phenomena and Quantum Matter (EPQM) group at IISER Kolkata. The groupâ€™s work involves studying quantum models of correlation and obtaining novel emergent states of matter. The models that have been studied involve quantum magnetism, strong correlation, impurity physics, superconductivity, and others.</p>
<h2>Okay, but is there anything interesting here?</h2>
<p>Take a look at these pages.</p>
<ul>
<li>My thoughts on certain deep ideas of physics and nature.</li>
<li>Using the power of scripting languages to do cool stuff.</li>
<li>Do you like anime?</li>
</ul>
