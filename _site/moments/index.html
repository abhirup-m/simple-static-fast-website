<p>Anime refers to a specific form of media - hand-drawn or computer-generated animated shows that originate from Japan. Anime differ from western animation productions in various aspects - art style, themes, target audience, etc. Anime have a distinct 2D style that has a particular appeal and that sets it apart from computer generated animation. The themes explored in anime are often very serious, ranging from shows like <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> and <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/339/Serial_Experiments_Lain">Serial Experiments Lain</a> that focus on the human psyche and depression, to more modern shows like <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note">Death Note</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass__Hangyaku_no_Lelouch">Code Geass</a> and <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin">Attack on Titan</a> that deal with topics like racism, genocide and the subjective nature of morality. Some very popular and mainstream anime include Dragon Ball, Pok√©mon and Naruto. </p>
<p>Here are some moments in various anime series that have become iconic over the years and that portray the depth, intrigue and beauty of storytelling in this form of media. I have restricted myself to one moment per show, for the sake of versatility. </p>
